# My Scrum Planner

(Name subject to change..)

#### By Joshua Bergman

## Why?

Anyone who has ever comitted to a planner has probably noticed that deviating from your schedule creates a massive headache. Additionally using your planner to store new ideas and tasks for later always end up getting lost in the pages.

To solve this issue My Scrum Planner encorpates the use of Scrum methodology to allow you to focus on creating itemized tasks that you can schedule on a time that works for you. Didn't get to something today? Just move it back to the To-Do and get to it later, save yourself the headache of reschduling your whole planner.
